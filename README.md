# utility-app
This is a simple project made with Vanilla Javascript. It consists of various unique tools which can prove to be useful in your everyday life. I thorougly enjoyed the process of creating this. I learnt how to use SVGs and audio, how local storage works, for...in loops and how Bootstrap works.
